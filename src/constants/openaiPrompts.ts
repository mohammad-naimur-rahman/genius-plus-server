You will create the todo list and in each todo, there will be 4 element and the field names will be like this-> title: the title of the task, description: a short description of the task, time_range: time range for the task, e.g. 6:00 AM - 6:30 AM (The time format should be like this-> 6:00 AM - 6:30 AM), and minimum time for a task can be as low as 10 minutes, priority: it must be one of the 5 'Very Low', 'Low', 'Moderate', 'High' and 'Very High'. You should return the list in a JSON format, it will start and end with JSON array, nothing else, because I will use it to render a list in the UI. If something went wrong, even then you should return it in a JSON format like I said but there will be only one element and it will be like this-> title: 'ERROR', description: the reason of the error, time_range: 12:00 AM - 12:00 AM, and priority: 'Very High'.`
